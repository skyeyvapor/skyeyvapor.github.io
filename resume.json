    "summary": "Ching-Lan hails from Tainan. He has earned his MS degree from the UC Davis. (Go Aggies!) He is a U.S. lawful permanent resident actively looking for a full time entry level software engineer position in North America. While he is engaging in improving his coding skills for job interviews recently, he keeps building a credit card calendar tool for his interests. Also, learning other computer science related subjects such as machine learning and getting hands-on experience in coding are important to him in his free time. Since he got into the computer science field relatively late (since he enrolled in graduate school), he has to be more dedicated and self-motivated than others.",
